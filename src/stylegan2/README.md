# StyleGAN2 Latent Space Manipulation Code

The code in this section relies on the NVIDIA-developed StleGAN2-ADA official PyTorch implementation (https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2-ada-pytorch), as well as the pretrained model for CelebA-HQ (https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/research/models/stylegan2), which have been excluded from this repo.
